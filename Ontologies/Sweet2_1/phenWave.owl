For example: if a wave moves along the x-axis, its disturbances are in the yz-plane. In other words, it causes medium disturbances across the two-dimensional plane that it is travelling in. Contrary to popular belief, transversal waves do not necessarily move up and down.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#SurfaceWave" />
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Rayleigh waves, also called ground roll, are surface waves that travel as ripples similar to those on the surface of water. The existence of these waves was predicted by John William Strutt, Lord Rayleigh, in 1885. They are slower than body waves, roughly 70% of the velocity of S waves, and have been asserted to be visible during an earthquake in an open space like a parking lot where the cars move up and down with the waves. Reports among seismologists suggest that the apparent motion may be due to distortion of the human eye during shaking. Anecdotally, placing people on shake tables causes the room to appear to ripple. In any case, waves of the reported amplitude, wavelength, and velocity of the visible waves have never been recorded instrumentally.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A wave in fluid motion having its maximum amplitude within the fluid or at an internal boundary (interface). The concepts of internal and external waves originated in the study of gravity waves in homogeneous incompressible fluids, and it makes no difference in the dynamics of the wave whether the static stability of the fluid is concentrated in a free surface or in an interface. However, internal waves in a fluid with continually varying density have maximum amplitudes and nodal surfaces within the fluid itself, so that these are properly distinguished from external waves.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">1. Any wave motion in which no form of energy other than kinetic energy is present. In this general sense, Helmholtz waves, barotropic disturbances, Rossby waves, etc., are inertia waves. 2. More restrictedly, a wave motion in which the source of kinetic energy of the disturbance is the rotation of the fluid about some given axis. In the atmosphere a westerly wind system is such a source, the inertia waves here being, in general, stable. A similar analysis has been applied to smaller vortices, such as the hurricane.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">P waves are longitudinal or compressional waves, which means that the ground is alternately compressed and dilated in the direction of propagation. In solids these waves generally travel slightly less than twice as fast as S waves and can travel through any type of material. In air, these pressure waves take the form of sound waves, hence they travel at the speed of sound. Typical speeds are 330 m/s in air, 1450 m/s in water and about 5000 m/s in granite. P waves are sometimes called primary waves. When generated by an earthquake they are less destructive than the S waves and surface waves that follow them, due to their lesser amplitudes. </rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Surface waves are analogous to water waves and travel just under the Earth's surface. They travel more slowly than body waves. Because of their low frequency, long duration, and large amplitude, they can be the most destructive type of seismic wave. There are two types of surface waves: Rayleigh waves and Love waves. Theoretically, surface waves can be understood as systems of interacting P and/or S waves.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">S waves are transverse or shear waves, which means that the ground is displaced perpendicularly to the direction of propagation. In the case of horizontally polarized S waves, the ground moves alternately to one side and then the other. S waves can travel only through solids, as fluids (liquids and gases) do not support shear stresses. Their speed is about 60% of that of P waves in a given material. S waves are sometimes called secondary waves, and are several times larger in amplitude than P waves for earthquake sources.</rdfs:comment>
