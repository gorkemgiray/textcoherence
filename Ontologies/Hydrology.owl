        <rdfs:comment>The ontology is a module within the larger Ordnance Survey Topographic ontology.   It references other modules within the larger ontology.   Most of the other modules are currently incomplete.   They are however sufficiently complete to support the hydrology module.

The rationale behind the hydrology module itself is to provide a minimal set of definitions to maximise the abiliuty to reuse.   As a result it contains a shallow hierarchy and minimal property restrictions and explicit disjoints.   It is our expectation that when applied to a specific task, the nature of the task will indicate which restictions and disjoints are required.</rdfs:comment>
